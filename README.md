# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-and-Alarm-System

'Drowsiness Detection and Alarm System will be developed using non-intrusive machine vision-based concepts. We hope to test the proposed method to detect fatigue after carefully observing and analyzing the driverâ€™s face and eyes. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The system deals with using information obtained for the binary version of the image to find the edges of the face, which narrows down the area of where the eyes may exist. Considering the knowledge that the eye regions in the face present great intensity changes, the eyes are located by finding the significant intensity changes in the face.'
